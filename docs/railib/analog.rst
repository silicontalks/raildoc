Custom RAIL Cells Library
=========================

The key idea of the RAIL project is to utilize the recent digitalized design trend in AMS blocks
(like ADPLL/MDLL/DLDO/SADC, etc.).
With the trend, we would like to limit the cell choice for AMS designs.
Here, we define four categories, switches, delay cells, passives and analog marcros.
The RAIL library provide a reference designs for all these cells.
